# Space-ship-game
Simple 2D space ship game based on this great Youtube [toutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoAsDlUwjy0&t=5343s).
The game is writen in C instead of Python that is used in the toutorial.

The game was supposed to be my first try at game dev and a remider how to use C.
The build scripts and enviroment setup are copied from [raylib-quickstart](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart)

The desing of a game logic is quite suboptimal.
Main game logic depends on an object manager implemented as a double linked list.
